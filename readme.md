## Directions

Now you try.  For the workshop, we've prebuilt a data set that has information about menus in Duke's Brodhead Center from three restaurants.  

1. From the File menu, open a New R Notebook:  `File > New File > R Notebook`
1. Reading the preloaded directions in your new script, add a code chunk at line 20.  (Hint: *Ctrl+Alt+I*)
1. Load the `tidyverse` package.  In that code-chunk, type: `library(tidyverse)` and run the code chunk.
1. Now you are ready to make new code chunks and follow the steps in Exercise 1 (below).


## Exercise 1: Loading Data

1. Using what we've you've seen in class, if `data/brodheadCenter.csv` is a csv file, how would you load the file into a new object called `brodhead`?

2. What is the data structure of the `brodhead`?

3. Take a look at the structure of the `brodhead` object.
    - How many observations (rows) are there?
    - How many variables (columns) are there?
    - How many of the variables are numeric data?
